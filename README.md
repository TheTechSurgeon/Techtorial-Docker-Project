# Techtorial-Docker-Project
This project demostrates our students mastery with Docker Products.

## Instructions:

Now it's time to build a project that brings together the skils you've learned in docker.

I have 2 sets of instructions for you. These instructions are built so that you can check your mastery

The 1st has minimal tips and should be what you refer to for most of the project.

The 2nd set is inside a folder named Take-a-break-and-think-5 and contains more explicit instructions with some code examples. DO NOT open this one unless you've been stuck on the current step for at least 5 minutes or more. 

### things to do during the 5 minutes
    - take a look back at class slides for docker.
    - look at the hands-on practice we did. 
    - google the command you are trying to use and see if you can find the Docker documentation.

*This will help build vital troubleshooting skills that will make you more self sufficient and desirable to employers*

If you feel you still need help after referring to the 2nd set please let me know I will still be here assisting students when they have questions
